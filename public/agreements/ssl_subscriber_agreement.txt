CERTIFICATE SERVICES AGREEMENT

This is a binding legal agreement between SSL Corp., a Nevada corporation doing business as SSL.com (“SSL.com”) and the person who establishes a Certificate Services account with SSL.com (“you”).

• By submitting an Application, you are making legal representations and warranties to SSL.com and third parties who rely on your Certificate.

• SSL.com may revoke your Certificate if you violate this Agreement, and on other grounds described below.

• An individual who submits an Application for Certificate Services on behalf of a company or other legal entity represents and warrants to SSL.com that he or she has the legal authority to submit the Application and bind that entity to this Agreement.

Capitalized terms used in this document have special meanings as stated in Section 12 (Definitions).

This Agreement includes a binding arbitration clause and class action waiver provision.  This means that you are required to use arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes rather than a court action with a jury, or a class action.


1. Application for Certificate Services, Certificate Signing Requests

On your submission of all information required to establish an account for Certificate Services and each Certificate Signing Request, and payment of the applicable fee, SSL.com will process your Application.
SSL.com will use commercially reasonable efforts to verify the information provided by you in your Application.  SSL.com has no obligation to accept your Application, and may refuse to do so on any reasonable basis.

2. Certificate Services

If SSL.com accepts your Application, it will provide the Certificate Services you purchased subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions stated in the Agreement.  This Agreement applies to all Certificate Signing Requests and Certificates, including the initial and all subsequent multiple requests that you may make.  The Certificate Services are provided on a subscription basis for a limited term.  SSL.com has no obligation to provide the Certificate Services following expiration of the initial term or any renewal term unless you have renewed the Certificate Services prior to expiration as provided in this Agreement. Your right to use any Certificates issued during the term of your Certificate Services expires on expiration of the Certificate Services.  SSL.com may terminate the Certificate Services, and revoke any Certificates prior to expiration of your subscription term for your violation of this Agreement and other grounds as provided in Section 6 (Term and Termination) below.

SSL.com may test its pre-production systems by creating concurrent versions of your Certificate.  These test certificates are for test purposes only and may not be used by you or SSL.com in a production environment.  On your request, we will provide you with a copy of any test certificate we create, provided you acknowledge this limitation in writing.

You must identify at least one individual (natural person) as your authorized employee or agent to submit a Certificate Signing Request on your behalf (each a “Representative”).  The Representative(s) must be named using SSL.com’s online dashboard, or other SSL.com approved process.
