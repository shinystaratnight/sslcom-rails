      %h2 What is the #{community_name} Reseller/Referral Link/Partner Program?
      %h3
        At #{community_name} we value our relationships with our customers and partners who work with their
        business associates and customers to promote #{community_name} certificates. As a result, we've
        launched the #{community_name} Partner Program to help our customers and partners earn extra discounts
        and commissions when selling bulk #{community_name} certificates. We currently offer two distinct
        programs that are tailored to our partners' requirements: The #{community_name} Referral Link Program
        for commission-based revenue sharing and the #{community_name} Reseller Program for system integrators,
        host providers and resellers.
