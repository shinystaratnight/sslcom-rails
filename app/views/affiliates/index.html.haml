      %h3
        At SSL.com we value our relationships with our customers and partners who work with their
        business associates and customers to promote SSL.com certificates. As a result, we've
        launched the SSL.com Partner Program to help our customers and partners earn extra discounts
        and commissions when selling bulk SSL.com certificates. We currently offer two distinct
        programs that are tailored to our partners' requirements: The SSL.com Referral Link Program
        for commission-based revenue sharing and the SSL.com Reseller Program for system integrators,
        host providers and resellers.
