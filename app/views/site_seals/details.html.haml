    The #{Settings.community_name} Smart SeaL is a complementary service that
    establishes trust by declaring your site's use of #{Settings.community_name} certificates and
    it comes free with every #{Settings.community_name} certificate installed.
    Displaying the #{Settings.community_name} Smart SeaL let's your customers know that
    your organization values online security and privacy.
  %p
    When a visitor
    clicks on the #{Settings.community_name} Smart SeaL, a real-time generated #{Settings.community_name} Site Report
    appears that displays summary information about your organization and status
    information about the #{Settings.community_name} certificate installed on your website.

    There
    simply is no better way to build trust with your visitors and avoid cart
    abandonment than by displaying your use of #{Settings.community_name} certificates.
  %p
    The #{Settings.community_name} Site Report displays information such as the website address,
    the status of and assurances about the #{Settings.community_name} certificate,
    basic information about the website's owner/operator, and verification
    assurances about the website owner's identity.
  %p
    This report helps to reassure
    the visitor that a third-party, globally-trusted certificate authority such
    as #{Settings.community_name} has undertaken the required steps to validate the website as
    outlined in our Certificate Practices Statement.
  %p
    With a trusted name like #{Settings.community_name}, your website's Site Report not only has the
    backing of a reputable, globally-trusted certificate authority, but also
    a company which abides by the Webtrust audit program, the
    governing program that all globally-trusted certificate authorities must
    follow.
  %p
    This program is designed to ensure that #{Settings.community_name}'s processes remain
    transparent and that we strictly follow these processes. In short, your
    website's #{Settings.community_name} certificate and Site Report has assurances and features
    that no other company can offer.

  Increase transparency with the #{Settings.community_name} Smart SeaL Artifacts
.default_container
  %h3 Smart SeaL Artifacts
  %p
    To help build upon this trust, #{Settings.community_name} now offers the validated documents
    as Smart SeaL Artifacts within the Site Report.
    This patent pending service increases
    transparency by optionally allowing your visitors to review the documents
    we used to validate your organization as part of the process to issue your
    website's #{Settings.community_name} certificate.

  %p
    You have the option to publish all pages,
    select pages or no pages of these documents. You can even turn this feature
    off in the event you'd like to only use the Site Report. Depending on which
    #{Settings.community_name} certificate you purchase, the validation documents report comes free
    as part of your #{Settings.community_name} certificate service
    or you can purchase the service as an add-on to the
    #{Settings.community_name} Smart SeaL that comes with your website's #{Settings.community_name} certificate.
