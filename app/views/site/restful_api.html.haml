  %h3 Program Overview
  %p
    The SSL.com RESTful API Program is an open standards based, RESTful api that allows resellers and systems
    integrators to automatically manage their ssl certificates through SSL.com's backfacing interface.
    The api is freely available to users with reseller accounts
    (#{link_to "click here for more details on SSL.com Reseller Program", details_resellers_url(subdomain: Reseller::SUBDOMAIN)}).
    However, the api is currently in beta-testing mode and not currently open to
    general signup. If you are a hosting provider, registrar, or other reseller with specific volume
    requirements and would like to participate in beta-testing the api, please contact us at support@ssl.com.
