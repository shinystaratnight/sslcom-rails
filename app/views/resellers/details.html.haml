  %p
    The SSL Reseller Program is designed to ease management of bulk ssl
    certificate purchases while increasing your bottom line through volume
    discounting. With the SSL Reseller Program, you can view real-time
    processing status information of each certificate, run historical reports
    on your certificate purchases, and do a host of other administrative
    functions. And that's just the beginning....
  %p
    Depending on your projected sales volume of ssl certificates, you can "buy"
    into a higher discounting bracket
    (#{link_to "click here for pricing tiers", reseller_tiers_path}), resulting
    in lowered costs and increased profitability. These brackets are suitable
    for organizations of all sizes; from independent consultants to government
    institutions to globally based hosting companies, there's a right fit for
    everyone.

    administrative screen and choose from a number of designs; you can choose
    a different design for each site.

    certificate needs. Set reminders for expiring ssl certificates and
    customize the reminder notices to gain more control over what is included in
    each reminder. You can even set the time period when they are sent out and

    into your order history as well as SSL Certificate purchase history.
