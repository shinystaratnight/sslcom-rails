  %h3 SSL Certificate RESTful API Overview
  %p
    Software developers can now leverage the power of SSL secure data storage into
    mobile device platforms and other software that require a secure, remote
    data storage option. The Lockbox api provides an open standard interface in the
    form of REST using the well established http protocol and JSON standards.
    By adopting well-established standards, the api minimizes the learning
    curve for the development team and results in faster deployment.
  %p
    Leveraging this open standard api, developers can reliably store data onto SSL.com's
    ultra-secure servers. Since SSL Secure Lockbox handles the encryption
    and redundant data storage, developers only need to focus on the basic elements file
    operations such as uploading, downloading, renaming, sharing, etc.
  %h3 Getting Started
  %p
    In order to access and even create accounts on behalf of individual users,
    developer's are required to obtain an account token and secret key pair for
    each app that will be interfacing with Lockbox. This can be done by creating
    a standard Lockbox account and clicking the 'create app' link in the dashboard.
