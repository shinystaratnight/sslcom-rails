  Stop - there might be a problem with the requested link

  The link you requested has been identified by bitly as being potentially problematic. This could be because a bitly user has reported a problem, a black-list service reported a problem, because the link has been shortened more than once, or because we have detected potentially malicious content. This may be a problem because:

  Some URL-shorteners re-use their links, so bitly can't guarantee the validity of this link.
  Some URL-shorteners allow their links to be edited, so bitly can't tell where this link will lead you.
  Spam and malware is very often propagated by exploiting these loopholes, neither of which bitly allows for.

  The link you requested may contain inappropriate content, or even spam or malicious code that could be downloaded to your computer without your consent, or may be a forgery or imitation of another website, designed to trick users into sharing personal or financial information.
