Simply log into your ssl.com and click the 'validation' link for this particular ssl.com ev certificate order. From there, you can upload validation-related documents and images.

In rare cases, we may request additional data such as bank account details, a copy of the company registration document, or a legal opinion letter.

Extended Validation (EV) Certificates provide the best Internet Data Encryption and Identity Assurance available. Before any EV SSL Certificate can be issued, Comodo (the issuing certification authority) must independently obtain and validate information about the organization that requires the certificate, including verification of the physical address and registered business identity. All information that you may report to us regarding your employees will only be used to verify that this EV SSL Certificate Request has been authorized.

Glossary for the EV SSL Certificate Request Form:

1). Contract Signer: An upper management individual in the organization who is authorized to approve (typically C-Level) the EV contract. The EV SSL guidelines require that an upper management person approves the purchase so as to prohibit fraudulent attempts to obtain a certificate on behalf of the organization.

2). Certificate Approver: The person in the organization who can approve that the Requester has permission to order the EV SSL Certificate on behalf of the organization.

3). Certificate Requester: Typically this will be the person who made the EV SSL request to us, and is receiving this email.

Note: In some cases, all three of the above roles may be the same individual.
