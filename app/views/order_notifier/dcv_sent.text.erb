Dear Customer,
<%end -%>

An SSL.com certificate order has been placed for <%=@certificate_order.certificate_content.csr.common_name%>

Please respond to the email validation request sent to: <%=@last_sent.email_address%>. It will be sent from comodo.com, our ssl vetting partner.
Note that SSL.com and Comodo are entirely separate companies so all inquiries must be directed to SSL.com.

PLEASE DO NOT REPLY TO THIS EMAIL. As mentioned previously, another email is being sent to <%=@last_sent.email_address%> so please be on lookout for that email.

If you would prefer the request be sent to a different address, please visit <%=new_certificate_order_validation_url(@certificate_order)%> to change the address.
