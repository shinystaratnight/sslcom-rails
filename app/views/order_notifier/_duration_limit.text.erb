Please note that since this certificate order has a duration that exceeds the 39 month hard limit set by the CA/Browser
Forum (see https://info.ssl.com/faq-39-month-limit-to-new-certificates-what-you-need-to-know/), this certificate will
expire in 36 months. However, you will be notified 60 days prior to expiration to reissue this certificate free of cost.
A new certificate will then be issued for the remaining duration of the order so that you can continue to benefit from
multi-year discounting while remaining compliant with the CA/Browser Forum requirements.
