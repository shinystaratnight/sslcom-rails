Are you aware SSL.com allows you to build more trust and transparency with your customers by displaying your SSL.com Smart SeaL? The SSL.com Smart SeaL allows you to optionally display documents that you submitted to SSL.com as part of the validation process of your SSL.com certificate. Once we verify each document, a green check of approval appears next to the document as proof of validity. Of course displaying any or all supplied documents is optional and can lead to increased trust levels.
