  %h3 Overview
  %p
    SSL certificates represent the underpinnings of trust in most Web and Internet transactions. As such,
    there is great responsibility for globally trusted certificate authorities like #{Settings.community_name} to perform
    accurate but timely validation checks so that legitimate entities can continue to operate in
    a secure and trusted manner.

  %h3 Validation Types
  %p
    Depending on which #{Settings.community_name} certificate is issued, different validation requirements need to be met in
    order for all parties to maintain strict adherence to #{Settings.community_name}'s Certification Practices Statement. At
    minimum, the customer (or subscriber) will be required to validate domain control by responding to
    an email sent to a predetermined email address. The customer purchasing the #{Settings.community_name} certificate may be
    required to submit validation artifacts and documents attesting to the ownership of or
    authorization to represent the original entity who registered the domain name listed as the subject in the ssl
    certificate.

            An email from #{Settings.community_name} Validation Services is sent to a predetermined email address associated
            with the domain name represented by the ssl certificate.
            A user with access to the email address then clicks on a link embedded within the email. This
            will confirm that the customer or authorized party has control of the domain name.

            To supplement domain control validation, high assurance validation utilizes supporting
            documentation to provide additional assurance that the customer owns or is authorized to represent
            the organization listed as the owner of the domain. The documents can be submitted through each
            #{Settings.community_name} certificate's order page or through
            the #{link_to "the #{Settings.community_name} RESTful API", "http://docs.sslcomapi.apiary.io/", target: "_new"}.
            The accepted documents are as follows:

            #{Settings.community_name}. EV SSL certificates that have gone through the extended validation progress
            display the browser address bar with a green background. In addition to using domain control and
            organization validation, extended validation requires that an authorized signer submit a completed
            EV SSL request form which can be found below:
