  %h3 Validation Types
  %p
    Depending on which SSL.com certificate is issued, different validation requirements need to be met in
    order for all parties to maintain strict adherence to SSL.com's Certification Practices Statement. At
    the minimum, the customer (or subscriber) will be required to validate domain control by responding to
    an email sent to a predetermined email address. The customer purchasing the SSL.com certificate may be
    required to submit required validation artifacts and documents attesting to the ownership of or
    authorization to represent the original entity who registered the domain name represented in the ssl
    certificate.

            documentation to provide additional assurance that the customer owns or is authorized to represent
            the organization listed as the owner of the domain. The documents can be submitted through each
            SSL.com certificate's order page or through
