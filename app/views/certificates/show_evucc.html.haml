    The Enterprise EV Unified Communications Certificate (UCC) provides SSL security for
    Microsoft Exchange and Communications Server. Unlike standard or even
    wildcard ssl certificates, a single Enterprise EV UCC can provide SSL secured
    communications on a number of different domains, both internal and external,
    reducing server security administration complexity, and cost. In addition,
    Enterprise EV UCC support the Microsoft Exchange Auto discover service, a
    feature of the Exchange platform which greatly eases client administration.

    information, patient data and many other types of private material, and
    SSL is also a key component of PCI-compliance which is mandated for
    organizations wanting to accept credit card information. Enterprise EV UC
