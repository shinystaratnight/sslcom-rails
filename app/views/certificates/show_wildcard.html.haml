    Wildcard SSL certificates eliminate the need to install a separate digital
    certificate for each subdomain by allowing you to use an unlimited number
    of subdomains in the certificate. Any site that has a domain that matches
    *.yourdomain.com (where * can be anything and yourdomain.com is any domain
    with the wildcard certificate installed on) will be secured by a Wildcard
    SSL digital certificate. And since Wildcard SSL is a high assurance ssl
    certificate, it provides a high level of validation to your customers.

    With a 99.3% acceptance rate of browsers used on the Internet, your website
    will not get confidence-killing popups that result from untrusted or
    invalid SSL certificates. These popups scare potential customers away and
    will result in lost sales. Our vetting process is simple, quick, and meets
    the recommended requirements of the United States Department of Defense.
    With each Wildcard SSL certificate, you are extending industry level
    validation and encryption technology to each customer and transaction.

    SSL is an essential part of almost all electronic transactions involved in
    transmitting sensitive data such as usernames and passwords, credit card
    information, patient data and many other types of private material, and SSL
    is also a key component of PCI-compliance which is mandated for
    organizations wanting to accept credit card information. High Assurance SSL
    certificates meet all the critieria above and adds more value.
  %p
