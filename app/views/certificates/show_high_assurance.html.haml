    SSL is an essential part of almost all electronic transactions involved in
    transmitting sensitive data such as usernames and passwords, credit card
    information, patient data and many other types of private material, and
    SSL is also a key component of PCI-compliance which is mandated for
    organizations wanting to accept credit card information. High Assurance
    SSL certificates meet all the critieria above and even add more value.
