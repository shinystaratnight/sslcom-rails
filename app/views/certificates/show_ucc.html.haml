    The Unified Communications Certificate (UCC) provides SSL security for
    Microsoft Exchange and Communications Server. Unlike standard or even
    wildcard ssl certificates, a single UCC can provide SSL secured
    communications on a number of different domains, both internal and external,
    reducing server security administration complexity, and cost. In addition,
    UCC SSL supports the Microsoft Exchange Auto discover service, a
    feature of the Exchange platform which greatly eases client administration.

    SSL is an essential part of almost all electronic transactions involved in
    transmitting sensitive data such as usernames and passwords, credit card
    information, patient data and many other types of private material, and
    SSL is also a key component of PCI-compliance which is mandated for
    organizations wanting to accept credit card information. UCC SSL
    certificates meet all the critieria above and even adds more value.
  %p

    confidence building SSL Secure Smart SeaL, a $125,000 performance guaranty,
