    Nothing beats free, and 60 days of Free SSL encryption with the SSL Site
    Seal is even better! These free certificate have the same encryption
    strength and browser acceptance rates as the higher assurance validation 
    SSL certificates, only they're free. We can offer free ssl certificates
    since only a domain validation check is performed on Free SSL certificates.
  %p
    Because of the lower validation level, these certificates are
    not ideally suited for ecommerce situations or where establishing trust
    value is of the utmost importance (see
    #{link_to "High Assurance", certificate_path(:id=>'high_assurance')} or
    #{link_to "EV SSL", certificate_path(:id=>'ev')} for commercial grade ssl
    certificate) since only a class 1 validation check is performed.
  %p
    However, these certificates work great for smaller, non-ecommerce sites
    such as blogs or free sites. They also work great for development purposes.
    And because they are good for entire year, you don't need to worry about
    a small timeframe in which to test out ssl functions. You have an entire
    year to work with a Free SSL certificate!
  %p
    And of course SSL is an essential part of almost all electronic
    transactions involved in
    transmitting sensitive data such as usernames and passwords, credit card
    information, patient data and many other types of private material. So get
    started with a Free SSL Certificate and get secured today!
