== Resources

Install

  Rails

   * To install as a plugin:

 Generate your note model:
 
 script/generate note
 
 Then migrate your database:
 
 rake db:migrate

== Usage
 * Make your ActiveRecord model act as notable.
 
 class Model < ActiveRecord::Base
 	acts_as_notable
 end
 
 * Add a note to a model instance
 
 notable = Model.create
 notable.notes.create(:title => "First note.", :note => "This is the first note.")

 * Fetch notes for a notable model:
 
 notable = Model.find(1)
 notes = notable.notes.recent.limit(10).all

 # Following doesn't work/make sense to me. Leaving for historical sake -- Jack
 # * Each note reference notable object
 #
 # model = Model.find(1)
 # model.notes.get(0).notable == model
