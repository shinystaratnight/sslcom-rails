Description:
	The billable migration generator creates a migration with the required tables to use acts_as_billable:
	
    orders
    line_items
    invoices
    payments

Example:
    ./script/generate billable_migration add_billable_tables

    This will create an AddBillableTables migration in db/migrate/.  Run "rake db:migrate" to update your database
